# Security Tools

A collection of Python-based security automation tools developed as part of my 12-month security research curriculum. This repository showcases practical offensive security tooling with emphasis on clarity, documentation, and ethical use.

## üéØ Purpose

This repository documents my journey from career transition to security researcher, with focus on:
- Python security automation
- Web application security testing
- Cloud security assessment (AWS/Azure)
- AI/LLM red teaming
- Building in public

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools

### Phase 1: Foundations (Months 1-2)
- [ ] **Log Parser & Analyzer** - Parse and analyze security logs (syslog, Apache, nginx)
- [ ] **Port Scanner** - TCP/UDP scanning with service detection
- [ ] **Subdomain Enumerator** - DNS enumeration and certificate transparency
- [ ] **Web Vulnerability Scanner** - Basic XSS and SQL injection detection
